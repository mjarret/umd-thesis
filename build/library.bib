abstract = {In this paper, we give an easy proof of the main results of Andrews and Clutterbuck's paper [J. Amer. Math. Soc. 24 (2011), no. 3, 899--916], which gives both a sharp lower bound for the spectral gap of a Schr$\backslash$"oinger operator and a sharp modulus of concavity for the logarithm of the corresponding first eigenfunction. We arrive directly at same estimates by the `double coordinate' approach and asymptotic behavior of parabolic flows. Although using the techniques appeared in the above paper, we partly simplify the method and argument. This maybe help to provide an easy way for estimating spectral gap. Besides, we also get a new lower bound of spectral gap for a class of Sch$\backslash$"odinger operator.},

abstract = {We propose an adiabatic quantum algorithm for generating a quantum pure state encoding of the PageRank vector, the most widely used tool in ranking the relative importance of internet pages. We present extensive numerical simulations which provide evidence that this algorithm can prepare the quantum PageRank state in a time which, on average, scales polylogarithmically in the number of webpages. We argue that the main topological feature of the underlying web graph allowing for such a scaling is the out-degree distribution. The top ranked \$\backslash log(n)\$ entries of the quantum PageRank state can then be estimated with a polynomial quantum speedup. Moreover, the quantum PageRank state can be used in "q-sampling" protocols for testing properties of distributions, which require exponentially fewer measurements than all classical schemes designed for the same task. This can be used to decide whether to run a classical update of the PageRank.},

abstract = {In this article, by extending the method of Andrews and Clutterbuck (2011) [2] we prove a sharp estimate on the expansion modulus of the gradient of the logarithm of the parabolic kernel to the Schr\"{o}dinger operator with convex potential on a bounded convex domain. The result improves an earlier work of Brascamp–Lieb which asserts the log-concavity of the parabolic kernel. We also give an alternate proof to a corresponding estimate on the first eigenfunction of the Schr\"{o}dinger operator, obtained firstly by Andrews and Clutterbuck via the study of the asymptotics to a parabolic problem. Our proof is more direct via an elliptic maximum principle. An alternate proof of the fundamental gap theorem of Andrews and Clutterbuck (2011) [2], by considering the quotient of moduli of continuity, is also obtained. Moreover we derive a Neumann eigenvalue comparison result and some other lower estimates on the first Neumann eigenvalue for Laplace operator with a drifting term, including an explicit estimate on a conjecture of P. Li. },

abstract = {We establish adiabatic theorems with and without spectral gap condition for general operators \$A(t): D(A(t)) \backslash subset X \backslash to X\$ with possibly time-dependent domains in a Banach space \$X\$. We first prove adiabatic theorems with uniform and non-uniform spectral gap condition (including a slightly extended adiabatic theorem of higher order). In these adiabatic theorems the considered spectral subsets \$\backslash sigma(t)\$ have only to be compact -- in particular, they need not consist of eigenvalues. We then prove an adiabatic theorem without spectral gap condition for not necessarily (weakly) semisimple eigenvalues: in essence, it is only required there that the considered spectral subsets \$\backslash sigma(t) = \backslash\{ \backslash lambda(t) \backslash\}\$ consist of eigenvalues \$\backslash lambda(t) \backslash in \backslash partial \backslash sigma(A(t))\$ and that there exist projections \$P(t)\$ reducing \$A(t)\$ such that \$A(t)|\_\{P(t)D(A(t))\}-\backslash lambda(t)\$ is nilpotent and \$A(t)|\_\{(1-P(t))D(A(t))\}-\backslash lambda(t)\$ is injective with dense range in \$(1-P(t))X\$ for almost every\~{}\$t\$. In all these theorems, the regularity conditions imposed on \$t \backslash mapsto A(t)\$, \$\backslash sigma(t)\$, \$P(t)\$ are fairly mild. We explore the strength of the presented adiabatic theorems in numerous examples. And finally, we apply the adiabatic theorems for time-dependent domains to obtain -- in a very simple way -- adiabatic theorems for operators \$A(t)\$ defined by symmetric sesquilinear forms.},

More generally, for an arbitrary smooth potential in higher dimensions, our proof gives both a sharp lower bound for the spectral gap and a sharp modulus of concavity for the logarithm of the first eigenfunction, in terms of the diameter of the domain and a modulus of convexity for the potential.},

The proof follows from rearrangement inequalities going back at least to Hardy, Littlewood, and P\'{o}lya and is the one-dimensional discrete analogue of a well-known result for Schr\"{o}dinger operators. We also prove that the gap, $\lambda$2 − $\lambda$1, is increased by strictly symmetric-increasing perturbations in the case that D is symmetric. Finally, we give an inequality relating the lowest eigenvalues of four Jacobi matrices of the form T= L+D when their potentials D obey certain conditions.},

abstract = {Compact closed categories have found applications in modeling quantum information protocols by Abramsky-Coecke. They also provide semantics for Lambek's pregroup algebras, applied to formalizing the grammatical structure of natural language, and are implicit in a distributional model of word meaning based on vector spaces. Specifically, in previous work Coecke-Clark-Sadrzadeh used the product category of pregroups with vector spaces and provided a distributional model of meaning for sentences. We recast this theory in terms of strongly monoidal functors and advance it via Frobenius algebras over vector spaces. The former are used to formalize topological quantum field theories by Atiyah and Baez-Dolan, and the latter are used to model classical data in quantum protocols by Coecke-Pavlovic-Vicary. The Frobenius algebras enable us to work in a single space in which meanings of words, phrases, and sentences of any structure live. Hence we can compare meanings of different language constructs and enhance the applicability of the theory. We report on experimental results on a number of language tasks and verify the theoretical predictions.},

abstract = {In many different fields of science, it is useful to characterize physical states and processes as resources. Chemistry, thermodynamics, Shannon's theory of communication channels, and the theory of quantum entanglement are prominent examples. Questions addressed by a theory of resources include: Which resources can be converted into which other ones? What is the rate at which arbitrarily many copies of one resource can be converted into arbitrarily many copies of another? Can a catalyst help in making an impossible transformation possible? How does one quantify the resource? Here, we propose a general mathematical definition of what constitutes a resource theory. We prove some general theorems about how resource theories can be constructed from theories of processes wherein there is a special class of processes that are implementable at no cost and which define the means by which the costly states and processes can be interconverted one to another. We outline how various existing resource theories fit into our framework. Our abstract characterization of resource theories is a first step in a larger project of identifying universal features and principles of resource theories. In this vein, we identify a few general results concerning resource convertibility.},

In the first experiment, we test the membership weights of a list of exemplars with respect to two concepts, e.g., \{$\backslash$it Fruits\} and \{$\backslash$it Vegetables\}, and their conjunction \{$\backslash$it Fruits And Vegetables\}. In the second experiment, we test the membership weights of the same list of exemplars with respect to the same two concepts, but negating the second, e.g., \{$\backslash$it Fruits\} and \{$\backslash$it Not Vegetables\}, and again their conjunction \{$\backslash$it Fruits And Not Vegetables\}. The collected data confirm existing results on conceptual combination, namely, they show dramatic deviations from the predictions of classical (fuzzy set) logic and probability theory. More precisely, they exhibit conceptual vagueness, gradeness of membership, overextension and double overextension of membership weights with respect to the given conjunctions. Then, we show that the quantum probability model in Fock space recently elaborated to model Hampton's data on concept conjunction (Hampton, 1988a) and disjunction (Hampton, 1988b) faithfully accords with the collected data. Our quantum-theoretic modeling enables to describe these non-classical effects in terms of genuine quantum effects, namely `contextuality', `superposition', `interference' and `emergence'. The obtained results confirm and strenghten the analysis in Aerts (2009a) and Sozzo (2014) on the identification of quantum aspects in experiments on conceptual vagueness.

In particular, if the Hessian of the potential is bounded from below by a positive constant, the gap has a lower bound independent of the dimension. We also estimate the gap when the potential is not necessarily convex.},

Frobenius algebras are used to formalize the operations required to model the semantics of relative pronouns, including passing information between the relative clause and the modified noun phrase, as well as copying, combining, and discarding parts of the relative clause. We develop two instantiations of the abstract semantics, one based on a truth-theoretic approach and one based on corpus statistics.},

abstract = {Within the categorical compositional distributional model of meaning, we provide semantic interpretations for the subject and object roles of the possessive relative pronoun  whose'. This is done in terms of Frobenius algebras over compact closed categories. These algebras and their diagrammatic language expose how meanings of words in relative clauses interact with each other. We show how our interpretation is related to Montague-style semantics and provide a truth-theoretic interpretation. We also show how vector spaces provide a concrete interpretation and provide preliminary corpus-based experimental evidence. In a prequel to this article, we used similar methods and dealt with the case of subject and object relative pronouns.},
