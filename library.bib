abstract = {A celebrated important result due to Freedman, Larsen and Wang states that providing additive approximations of the Jones polynomial at the k'th root of unity, for constant k=5 and k>6, is BQP-hard. Together with the algorithmic results of Freedman et al and Aharonov et al, this gives perhaps the most natural BQP-complete problem known today and motivates further study of the topic. In this paper we focus on the universality proof; we extend the universality result of Freedman et al to k's that grow polynomially with the number of strands and crossings in the link, thus extending the BQP-hardness of Jones polynomial approximations to all values for which the AJL algorithm applies, proving that for all those values, the problems are BQP-complete. As a side benefit, we derive a fairly elementary proof of the Freedman et al density result, without referring to advanced results from Lie algebra representation theory, making this important result accessible to computer science audience. We make use of two general lemmas we prove, the Bridge lemma and the Decoupling lemma, which provide tools for establishing density of subgroups in SU(n). Those tools seem to be of independent interest in more general contexts of proving quantum universality. Our result also implies a completely classical statement, that the{\_}multiplicative{\_} approximations of the Jones polynomial, at exactly the same values, are {\#}P-hard, via a recent result due to Kuperberg. Since the first publication of those results in their preliminary form (arXiv:quant-ph/0605181v2), the methods we present here were used in several other contexts. This paper is an improved and extended version of the original results, and also includes discussions of the developments since then.},

abstract = {The Jones polynomial, discovered in 1984, is an important knot invariant in topology. Among its many connections to various mathematical and physical areas, it is known (due to Witten) to be intimately connected to Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT). The works of Freedman, Kitaev, Larsen and Wang provide an efficient simulation of TQFT by a quantum computer, and vice versa. These results implicitly imply the existence of an efficient quantum algorithm that provides a certain additive approximation of the Jones polynomial at the fifth root of unity, e{\^{}}{\{}2$\backslash$pi i/5{\}}, and moreover, that this problem is BQP-complete. Unfortunately, this important algorithm was never explicitly formulated. Moreover, the results mentioned are heavily based on TQFT, which makes the algorithm essentially inaccessible to computer scientists.   We provide an explicit and simple polynomial quantum algorithm to approximate the Jones polynomial of an n-strands braid with m crossings at any primitive root of unity e{\^{}}{\{}2$\backslash$pi i/k{\}}, where the running time of the algorithm is polynomial in m,n and k. Our algorithm is based, rather than on TQFT, on well known mathematical results. By the results of Freedman et. al., our algorithm solves a BQP complete problem.   The algorithm we provide exhibits a structure which we hope is generalizable to other quantum algorithmic problems. Candidates of particular interest are the approximations of other {\#}P-hard problems, most notably, the partition function of the Potts model, a model which is known to be tightly connected to the Jones polynomial.},

abstract = {The design of new quantum algorithms has proven to be an extremely difficult task. This paper considers a different approach to the problem, by studying the problem of 'quantum state generation'. This approach provides intriguing links between many different areas: quantum computation, adiabatic evolution, analysis of spectral gaps and groundstates of Hamiltonians, rapidly mixing Markov chains, the complexity class statistical zero knowledge, quantum random walks, and more.   We first show that many natural candidates for quantum algorithms can be cast as a state generation problem. We define a paradigm for state generation, called 'adiabatic state generation' and develop tools for adiabatic state generation which include methods for implementing very general Hamiltonians and ways to guarantee non negligible spectral gaps. We use our tools to prove that adiabatic state generation is equivalent to state generation in the standard quantum computing model, and finally we show how to apply our techniques to generate interesting superpositions related to Markov chains.},

abstract = {Understanding NP-complete problems is a central topic in computer science (NP stands for nondeterministic polynomial time). This is why adiabatic quantum optimization has attracted so much attention, as it provided a new approach to tackle NP-complete problems using a quantum computer. The efficiency of this approach is limited by small spectral gaps between the ground and excited states of the quantum computer's Hamiltonian. We show that the statistics of the gaps can be analyzed in a novel way, borrowed from the study of quantum disordered systems in statistical mechanics. It turns out that due to a phenomenon similar to Anderson localization, exponentially small gaps appear close to the end of the adiabatic algorithm for large random instances of NP-complete problems. This implies that unfortunately, adiabatic quantum optimization fails: The system gets trapped in one of the numerous local minima.},

For slow time variation of the Hamiltonian, the time evolution reduces to spectral subspaces bordered by gaps. 2. The eventual tunneling out of such spectral subspaces is smaller than any inverse power of the time scale if the Hamiltonian varies infinitly smoothly over a finite interval. Except for the existence of gaps, no assumptions are made on the nature of the spectrum. We apply these results to charge transport in quantum Hall Hamiltonians and prove that the flux averaged charge transport is an integer in the adiabatic limit.},

We will call such Hamiltonians, which are common in the natural world, stoquastic. An equivalent characterization of stoquastic Hamiltonians is that they have an entry-wise non-negative Gibbs density matrix for any temperature. We prove that LH-MIN for stoquastic Hamiltonians belongs to the complexity class AM -- a probabilistic version of NP with two rounds of communication between the prover and the verifier. We also show that 2-local stoquastic LH-MIN is hard for the class MA. With the additional promise of having a polynomial spectral gap, we show that stoquastic LH-MIN belongs to the class POSTBPP=BPPpath -- a generalization of BPP in which a post-selective readout is allowed. This last result also shows that any problem solved by adiabatic quantum computation using stoquastic Hamiltonians lies in PostBPP.},

abstract = {One of the classical results in graph theory is the matrix-tree theorem which asserts that the determinant of a cofactor of the combinatorial Laplacian is equal to the number of spanning trees in a graph (see [1, 17, 11, 15]). The usual notion of the combinatorial Laplacian for a graph involves edge weights. Namely, a Laplacian Image  forGis a matrix with rows and columns indexed by the vertex setVofG, and the (u,v)-entry of Image , foru,vinG,u≠v, is associated with the edge-weight of the edge (u,v). It is not so obvious to consider Laplacians with vertex weights (except for using some symmetric combinations of the vertex weights to define edge-weights). In this note, we consider a vertex weighted Laplacian which is motivated by a problem arising in the study of algebro-geometric aspects of the Bethe Ansatz [18]. The usual Laplacian can be regarded as a special case with all vertex-weights equal. We will generalize the matrix-tree theorem to matrix-tree theorems of counting “rooted” directed spanning trees. In addition, the characteristic polynomial of the vertex-weighted Laplacian has coefficients with similar interpretations. We also consider subgraphs with non-trial boundary. We will shown that the Laplacian with Dirichlet boundary condition has its determinant equal to the number of rooted spanning forests. The usual matrix-tree theorem is a special case with the boundary consisting of one single vertex.},

abstract = {Physical interactions in quantum many-body systems are typically local: Individual constituents interact mainly with their few nearest neighbors. This locality of interactions is inherited by a decay of correlation functions, but also reflected by scaling laws of a quite profound quantity: The entanglement entropy of ground states. This entropy of the reduced state of a subregion often merely grows like the boundary area of the subregion, and not like its volume, in sharp contrast with an expected extensive behavior. Such "area laws" for the entanglement entropy and related quantities have received considerable attention in recent years. They emerge in several seemingly unrelated fields, in the context of black hole physics, quantum information science, and quantum many-body physics where they have important implications on the numerical simulation of lattice models. In this Colloquium we review the current status of area laws in these fields. Center stage is taken by rigorous results on lattice models in one and higher spatial dimensions. The differences and similarities between bosonic and fermionic models are stressed, area laws are related to the velocity of information propagation, and disordered systems, non-equilibrium situations, classical correlation concepts, and topological entanglement entropies are discussed. A significant proportion of the article is devoted to the quantitative connection between the entanglement content of states and the possibility of their efficient numerical simulation. We discuss matrix-product states, higher-dimensional analogues, and states from entanglement renormalization and conclude by highlighting the implications of area laws on quantifying the effective degrees of freedom that need to be considered in simulations.},

abstract = {We propose an adiabatic quantum algorithm for generating a quantum pure state encoding of the PageRank vector, the most widely used tool in ranking the relative importance of internet pages. We present extensive numerical simulations which provide evidence that this algorithm can prepare the quantum PageRank state in a time which, on average, scales polylogarithmically in the number of webpages. We argue that the main topological feature of the underlying web graph allowing for such a scaling is the out-degree distribution. The top ranked {\$}\backslashlog(n){\$} entries of the quantum PageRank state can then be estimated with a polynomial quantum speedup. Moreover, the quantum PageRank state can be used in "q-sampling" protocols for testing properties of distributions, which require exponentially fewer measurements than all classical schemes designed for the same task. This can be used to decide whether to run a classical update of the PageRank.},

We implement the abstract categorical model of Coecke et al. (arXiv:1003.4394v1 [cs.CL]) using data from the BNC and evaluate it. The implementation is based on unsupervised learning of matrices for relational words and applying them to the vectors of their arguments. The evaluation is based on the word disambiguation task developed by Mitchell and Lapata (2008) for intransitive sentences, and on a similar new experiment designed for transitive sentences. Our model matches the results of its competitors in the first experiment, and betters them in the second. The general improvement in results with increase in syntactic complexity showcases the compositional power of our model.},

abstract = {Recent advances in quantum technology have led to the development and manufacturing of experimental programmable quantum annealers that could potentially solve certain quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems faster than their classical analogues. The applicability of such devices for many theoretical and practical optimization problems, which are often constrained, is severely limited by the sparse, rigid layout of the devices' quantum bits. Traditionally, constraints are addressed by the addition of penalty terms to the Hamiltonian of the problem, which in turn requires prohibitively increasing physical resources while also restricting the dynamical range of the interactions. Here we propose a method for encoding constrained optimization problems on quantum annealers that eliminates the need for penalty terms and thereby removes many of the obstacles associated with the implementation of these. We argue the advantages of the proposed technique and illustrate its effectiveness. We then conclude by discussing the experimental feasibility of the suggested method as well as its potential to boost the encodability of other optimization problems.},

@article{Hensen2015,
abstract = {For more than 80 years, the counterintuitive predictions of quantum theory have stimulated debate about the nature of reality. In his seminal work, John Bell proved that no theory of nature that obeys locality and realism can reproduce all the predictions of quantum theory. Bell showed that in any local realist theory the correlations between distant measurements satisfy an inequality and, moreover, that this inequality can be violated according to quantum theory. This provided a recipe for experimental tests of the fundamental principles underlying the laws of nature. In the past decades, numerous ingenious Bell inequality tests have been reported. However, because of experimental limitations, all experiments to date required additional assumptions to obtain a contradiction with local realism, resulting in loopholes. Here we report on a Bell experiment that is free of any such additional assumption and thus directly tests the principles underlying Bell's inequality. We employ an event-ready scheme that enables the generation of high-fidelity entanglement between distant electron spins. Efficient spin readout avoids the fair sampling assumption (detection loophole), while the use of fast random basis selection and readout combined with a spatial separation of 1.3 km ensure the required locality conditions. We perform 245 trials testing the CHSH-Bell inequality {\$}S \backslashleq 2{\$} and find {\$}S = 2.42 \backslashpm 0.20{\$}. A null hypothesis test yields a probability of {\$}p = 0.039{\$} that a local-realist model for space-like separated sites produces data with a violation at least as large as observed, even when allowing for memory in the devices. This result rules out large classes of local realist theories, and paves the way for implementing device-independent quantum-secure communication and randomness certification.},

They also provide semantics for Lambek's pregroup algebras, applied to formalizing the grammatical structure of natural language, and are implicit in a distributional model of word meaning based on vector spaces. Specifically, in previous work Coecke-Clark-Sadrzadeh used the product category of pregroups with vector spaces and provided a distributional model of meaning for sentences. We recast this theory in terms of strongly monoidal functors and advance it via Frobenius algebras over vector spaces. The former are used to formalize topological quantum field theories by Atiyah and Baez-Dolan, and the latter are used to model classical data in quantum protocols by Coecke-Pavlovic-Vicary. The Frobenius algebras enable us to work in a single space in which meanings of words, phrases, and sentences of any structure live. Hence we can compare meanings of different language constructs and enhance the applicability of the theory. We report on experimental results on a number of language tasks and verify the theoretical predictions.},

The complexity of the 2-local Hamiltonian problem has long been outstanding. Here we settle the question and show that it is QMA-complete. We provide two independent proofs; our first proof uses only elementary linear algebra. Our second proof uses a powerful technique for analyzing the sum of two Hamiltonians; this technique is based on perturbation theory and we believe that it might prove useful elsewhere. Using our techniques we also show that adiabatic computation with two-local interactions on qubits is equivalent to standard quantum computation.},

Examples of positively curved spaces for this definition include the discrete cube and discrete versions of the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. Moreover this generalization is consistent with the Bakry–{\'{E}}mery Ricci curvature for Brownian motion with a drift on a Riemannian manifold. Positive Ricci curvature is shown to imply a spectral gap, a L{\'{e}}vy–Gromov–like Gaussian concentration theorem and a kind of modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality.

abstract = {An understanding of the temporal evolution of isolated many-body quantum systems has long been elusive. Recently, meaningful experimental studies of the problem have become possible, stimulating theoretical interest. In generic isolated systems, non-equilibrium dynamics is expected to result in thermalization: a relaxation to states in which the values of macroscopic quantities are stationary, universal with respect to widely differing initial conditions, and predictable using statistical mechanics. However, it is not obvious what feature of many-body quantum mechanics makes quantum thermalization possible in a sense analogous to that in which dynamical chaos makes classical thermalization possible. For example, dynamical chaos itself cannot occur in an isolated quantum system, in which the time evolution is linear and the spectrum is discrete. Some recent studies even suggest that statistical mechanics may give incorrect predictions for the outcomes of relaxation in such systems. Here we demonstrate that a generic isolated quantum many-body system does relax to a state well described by the standard statistical-mechanical prescription. Moreover, we show that time evolution itself plays a merely auxiliary role in relaxation, and that thermalization instead happens at the level of individual eigenstates, as first proposed by Deutsch and Srednicki. A striking consequence of this eigenstate-thermalization scenario, confirmed for our system, is that knowledge of a single many-body eigenstate is sufficient to compute thermal averages-any eigenstate in the microcanonical energy window will do, because they all give the same result.},

We consider alternatives to ETH that have been proposed. We first show that von Neumann's quantum ergodic theorem (QET) relies on an assumption that is essentially equivalent to ETH. We also investigate whether initial states produced by a quench can lead to thermal behavior in systems that do not obey ETH after the quench, namely, integrable systems. We find examples of this, but only for initial states that obeyed ETH before the quench.},

abstract = {We establish adiabatic theorems with and without spectral gap condition for general operators {\$}A(t): D(A(t)) \backslashsubset X \backslashto X{\$} with possibly time-dependent domains in a Banach space {\$}X{\$}. We first prove adiabatic theorems with uniform and non-uniform spectral gap condition (including a slightly extended adiabatic theorem of higher order). In these adiabatic theorems the considered spectral subsets {\$}\backslashsigma(t){\$} have only to be compact -- in particular, they need not consist of eigenvalues. We then prove an adiabatic theorem without spectral gap condition for not necessarily (weakly) semisimple eigenvalues: in essence, it is only required there that the considered spectral subsets {\$}\backslashsigma(t) = \backslash{\{} \backslashlambda(t) \backslash{\}}{\$} consist of eigenvalues {\$}\backslashlambda(t) \backslashin \backslashpartial \backslashsigma(A(t)){\$} and that there exist projections {\$}P(t){\$} reducing {\$}A(t){\$} such that {\$}A(t)|{\_}{\{}P(t)D(A(t)){\}}-\backslashlambda(t){\$} is nilpotent and {\$}A(t)|{\_}{\{}(1-P(t))D(A(t)){\}}-\backslashlambda(t){\$} is injective with dense range in {\$}(1-P(t))X{\$} for almost every{\~{}}{\$}t{\$}. In all these theorems, the regularity conditions imposed on {\$}t \backslashmapsto A(t){\$}, {\$}\backslashsigma(t){\$}, {\$}P(t){\$} are fairly mild. We explore the strength of the presented adiabatic theorems in numerous examples. And finally, we apply the adiabatic theorems for time-dependent domains to obtain -- in a very simple way -- adiabatic theorems for operators {\$}A(t){\$} defined by symmetric sesquilinear forms.},

abstract = {We perform two experiments with the aim to investigate the effects of negation on the combination of natural concepts. In the first experiment, we test the membership weights of a list of exemplars with respect to two concepts, e.g., {\{}$\backslash$it Fruits{\}} and {\{}$\backslash$it Vegetables{\}}, and their conjunction {\{}$\backslash$it Fruits And Vegetables{\}}. In the second experiment, we test the membership weights of the same list of exemplars with respect to the same two concepts, but negating the second, e.g., {\{}$\backslash$it Fruits{\}} and {\{}$\backslash$it Not Vegetables{\}}, and again their conjunction {\{}$\backslash$it Fruits And Not Vegetables{\}}. The collected data confirm existing results on conceptual combination, namely, they show dramatic deviations from the predictions of classical (fuzzy set) logic and probability theory. More precisely, they exhibit conceptual vagueness, gradeness of membership, overextension and double overextension of membership weights with respect to the given conjunctions. Then, we show that the quantum probability model in Fock space recently elaborated to model Hampton's data on concept conjunction (Hampton, 1988a) and disjunction (Hampton, 1988b) faithfully accords with the collected data. Our quantum-theoretic modeling enables to describe these non-classical effects in terms of genuine quantum effects, namely `contextuality', `superposition', `interference' and `emergence'. The obtained results confirm and strenghten the analysis in Aerts (2009a) and Sozzo (2014) on the identification of quantum aspects in experiments on conceptual vagueness. Our results can be inserted within the general research on the identification of quantum structures in cognitive and decision processes.},

We focus on the finite system case relevant for adiabatic quantum computing and quantum annealing. Adiabaticity is defined in terms of closeness to the instantaneous steady state. While the general result is conceptually similar to the closed system case, there are important differences. Namely, a system initialized in the zero-eigenvalue eigenspace of {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}L{\}}(t){\$} will remain in this eigenspace with a deviation that is inversely proportional to the total evolution time {\$}T{\$}. In the case of a finite number of level crossings the scaling becomes {\$}T{\^{}}{\{}-\backslasheta{\}}{\$} with an exponent {\$}\backslasheta{\$} that we relate to the rate of the gap closing. For master equations that describe relaxation to thermal equilibrium, we show that the evolution time {\$}T{\$} should be long compared to the corresponding minimum inverse gap squared of {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}L{\}}(t){\$}. Our results are illustrated with several examples.},

The result improves an earlier work of Brascamp–Lieb which asserts the log-concavity of the parabolic kernel. We also give an alternate proof to a corresponding estimate on the first eigenfunction of the Schr{\"{o}}dinger operator, obtained firstly by Andrews and Clutterbuck via the study of the asymptotics to a parabolic problem. Our proof is more direct via an elliptic maximum principle. An alternate proof of the fundamental gap theorem of Andrews and Clutterbuck (2011) [2], by considering the quotient of moduli of continuity, is also obtained. Moreover we derive a Neumann eigenvalue comparison result and some other lower estimates on the first Neumann eigenvalue for Laplace operator with a drifting term, including an explicit estimate on a conjecture of P.

We arrive directly at same estimates by the `double coordinate' approach and asymptotic behavior of parabolic flows. Although using the techniques appeared in the above paper, we partly simplify the method and argument. This maybe help to provide an easy way for estimating spectral gap.

@article{Coecke2014,
abstract = {In many different fields of science, it is useful to characterize physical states and processes as resources. Chemistry, thermodynamics, Shannon's theory of communication channels, and the theory of quantum entanglement are prominent examples. Questions addressed by a theory of resources include: Which resources can be converted into which other ones? What is the rate at which arbitrarily many copies of one resource can be converted into arbitrarily many copies of another? Can a catalyst help in making an impossible transformation possible? How does one quantify the resource? Here, we propose a general mathematical definition of what constitutes a resource theory. We prove some general theorems about how resource theories can be constructed from theories of processes wherein there is a special class of processes that are implementable at no cost and which define the means by which the costly states and processes can be interconverted one to another. We outline how various existing resource theories fit into our framework. Our abstract characterization of resource theories is a first step in a larger project of identifying universal features and principles of resource theories. In this vein, we identify a few general results concerning resource convertibility.},

abstract = {We study several problems related to properties of non-negative matrices that arise at the boundary between quantum and classical probabilistic computation. Our results are twofold. First, we identify a large class of quantum Hamiltonians describing systems of qubits for which the adiabatic evolution can be efficiently simulated on a classical probabilistic computer. These are stoquastic local Hamiltonians with a "frustration free" ground-state. A Hamiltonian belongs to this class iff it can be represented as {\$}H=\backslashsum{\_}a H{\_}a{\$} where (1) every term {\$}H{\_}a{\$} acts non-trivially on a constant number of qubits, (2) every term {\$}H{\_}a{\$} has real non-positive off-diagonal matrix elements in the standard basis, and (3) the ground-state of {\$}H{\$} is a ground-state of every term {\$}H{\_}a{\$}. Secondly, we generalize the Cook-Levin theorem proving NP-completeness of the satisfiability problem to the complexity class MA -- a probabilistic analogue of NP. Specifically, we construct a quantum version of the k-SAT problem which we call "stoquastic k-SAT" such that stoquastic k-SAT is contained in MA for any constant {\$}k{\$}, and any promise problem in MA is Karp-reducible to stoquastic 6-SAT. This result provides the first non-trivial example of a MA-complete promise problem.},

@article{ADKLLR07,
abstract = { The model of adiabatic quantum computation has recently attracted attention in the physics and computer science communities, but its exact computational power has been unknown. We settle this question and describe an efficient adiabatic simulation of any given quantum algorithm. This implies that the adiabatic computation model and the standard quantum circuit model are polynomially equivalent. We also describe an extension of this result with implications to physical implementations of adiabatic computation. We believe that our result highlights the potential importance of the adiabatic computation model in the design of quantum algorithms and in their experimental realization.},
